# Solitude
Final collaborated product for HackerEarth's Hack2021 Hackathon


## Development
To run and see how all of this works
```git clone https://github.com/Qoyyuum/Solitude```

This project was done by separate individuals to solve a common problem. And thus begin our work in separate repo that would eventually come together to solve a problem of booking a time slot towards a specific location.

```git submodule update --remote --recursive```

To perform the actual development, please go to each individual repos here:

For the User App: https://github.com/Qoyyuum/Solitude-Client - Made with Quasar Framework
For the Admin App: https://github.com/yash9263/Solitude-admin-client - Made with React
For the Admin Backend: https://github.com/notjacobjun/Solitude-admin - Made with Spring Boot
